## Introduction

Having the ability to perform Interface Design is important when launching a product to the market. I have been focusing my knowledge on Interface Design and User Experience for over 2 years. To demonstrate my design skills, I have decided to clone one of the apps I use every day. I added a small touch to this project where you can listen to my personal playlist. It is worth noting that this clone is not responsive, and I have only designed it for desktop.
